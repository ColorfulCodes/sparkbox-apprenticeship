It takes many tools to do Data Visualizaition
_____________________________________________
Workflow
    01- Exploring with tableau
    02- Prototyping wit codepen and D3
    03- Production with REACT

    01 Tableau Prototyping (free public tool)
            Cons
                too wide for mobile
                storytelling

    02 D3

    01 Tilegram and IIllustrtator (Affinity Designer)
    02 SVG OMG - Cool web based 
    03 Angular and SVG (typescript, SVG Component)

    01 Tilegrames
    How do you take D# code and integrate it?
        (look into vue.js? maybe? 
                --> good for computed properties, 
                filtering data, and reusable path genetator 
                (taking shape files and convert it into sgv))
                    |
                takes a set of longitude and latitude and uses it for 
                drawing commands that svg renders
