Data
    Data is contextless information. 
    "Data" can be stored in several different ways but eventually given context by typing 
    (Typing, Type, Data Types)

    All primitives (except for null and undefined) are objects

    falsey values: 
        undefined, null, NAN, 0, (empty string), false

    lexical scoping (why IFFE extist):
        all of the things on the outside of the functions for in,
        but everything inside of that function only exists inside

    in javascript, no 2 arrays will ever be equal. you have to compare the values inside

    Everything in javascript is an object.

Big O Notation

    performance 
    youll know how fast your things are running
    how many times it the algorithm gonna run when i run it?
    time complexity of a given algorithm 

time complexity 
    |
    O(n)   - function ran one time and completed
    O(1)   - what you want to strive for (runs one time)/ accessing an array is O(1)- getting the value and not iterating 
    O(n^2) - example would be a nested loop

localStorage is similar to what a hashtable is

Design Patterns

    how to create different behaviors or implementations within a program
    observable is an example of a design Patterns
    common names we've given to
