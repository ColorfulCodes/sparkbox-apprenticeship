Thinking Beyond the Web:

    -I/O-bound programs   :
        - are constrained by data access. 
        - e.g.. AJAX, REST, HTTP, web
        -These are programs where adding more processing power or RAM often makes little difference

    -Client-Side Programs  :
        - interact directly with human beings
        - e.g.. GUI tools of all stripes, consumer applications, mobile apps, and web apps

    -Server-side programs  :      
        - HTTP, Ajax,and REST, communicating with JSON
        - websites, apps, and APIs live here

How Node.js Applications Work:

    - couples JavaScript with an event loop for quickly dispatching opera-tions when events occur

    - Event loop :
        1. load the programs
        2. while theres more to do, wait for something to happen
        3. execute callbacks
        4. exit process unless theres more to do
        - core feature of Node
        - “everything runs in parallel except your code.”
        - As long as there’s something left to do, Node.js’s event loop will keep spinning.
        - Whenever an event occurs, Node.js invokes any callbacks (event handlers) that are listening for that event

    Single-Threaded and Highly Parallel
        -Node.js is a single-threaded environment (only one line of your code will ever be executing at any time)
        -Rather than waiting line-by-line for an operation to finish, youcreate a callback function that will be invoked when the operation eventuallysucceeds or fails.


Aspects of Node.js Development:

    -Practical Programming:
        - producing real code that does something useful

    -Node.js Core: 
        - How information is shuttled between these layersis the kind of impactful architectural detail you’ll learn.
    
    -JavaScriptisms:
        - arrowfunctions, spread parameters, and destructuring assignment

Installing Node.js:

    - $node--version
        see what version you have installed
    
    -you can install nvm like so:
        - $curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh

    - Then install a specific version:
        - $nvm install v8.0.0gs
