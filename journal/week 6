There a lot that i must keep in mind while coding...    stay mindful.
for yourself and for others... coming back and being able to read and undertsnad oyur own code is a blessing. 
the ability to do that with others' code is even better. 

theres a lott that you have to keep in mind WHILE you code... to make your life a lot easier in the long run.
a few extra seconds never killed anyone.... or did it?!?
